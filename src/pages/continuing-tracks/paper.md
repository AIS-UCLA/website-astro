# Technical Paper Reading Group

The reading group meets every week from 4-6pm on Sunday. Each week we choose a new paper and read it before the meeting, and then come together to discuss cutting-edge technical AI safety research.

To maintain the quality of the discussion, we prefer that reading group participants have completed an intro fellowship or equivalent, and have sufficient technical expertise to engage meaningfully with the papers. If you are interested in joining the reading group, please message Will Zhou via email (willzhou97@g.ucla.edu) or on Discord (@willzhou97).
