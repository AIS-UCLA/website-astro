# Intro to AI Safety Fellowship

## About

The Intro to AI Safety Fellowship is a 6 week, quarter-long course which
explores the impact of increasingly powerful AI systems on society, explains
the problems which the AI safety field is currently working on, and goes over
active areas of research.

The program consists of a series of video and reading lessons which are
accompanied by weekly, collective meetings that expand on the topics covered
in the lessons. You can expect to learn from many prevailing sources in the
field which will help you develop a solid research agenda that you may work
towards in the following quarters.

### Curriculum Options

Since Fall 2023, we have started offering multiple tracks for our intro
fellowshups. Click on the links below to explore each tracks' associated
curricula:

- [Reinforcement Learning](/fellowships/rl): Create an agent that learns to play connect four.
- [Transformers](/fellowships/transformers): Understand language models and build GPT-2 from the ground up.
- [Diffusion](/fellowships/diffusion): Build your own text-to-image generation model like Stable Diffusion.
- [Computer Vision](/fellowships/cv): Design models to analyze images for object recognition and classification, recommended for those with little-to-no machine learning experience.
- [Governance](/fellowships/governance): Understand policy approaches to mitigating AI risk and propose ideas of your own.

## Eligibility

For our transformers fellowship, we're looking for students who meet any of the following requirements:

- Have taken CS 31 or an equivalent class OR
- Have worked on a Python project OR
- Have strong skills in another programming language
- Additionally, a basic understanding of machine learning fundamentals and
  familiarity with contemporary AI research would provide a good baseline for the
  courseâ€™s content.

For our governance fellowship, we do not enforce any particular requirements. However, we are very excited to see participants who:
- Have strong writing and communication ability
- Are familiar with US policy (e.g., have engaged in policy research or an internship)
- Have some familiarity with computer science or another technical field.
- Once again, these are not enforced! We encourage all participants to apply, because interest and motivation are the two traits we care most about.

## Apply

Applications are open for Fall Quarter 2024!

The deadline to apply is Friday, October 4 at 11:59 PM.

# Alignment Research Teams (ART)

ART is our new initiative for real-world AI safety research. We will be forming
small groups of AI Safety at UCLA fellows with organizers on an approved
alignment or ethics-related AI project. Please note that this should and will
be an intensive project, so expect to spend 3+ hours a week.

### Apply

Applications are not open yet for Fall Quarter 2024.
