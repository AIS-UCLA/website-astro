2. Understand the role AI governance plays in the broader field of AI safety.

Before next meeting, think (or write down) your answers to these questions:

1. If you were to pursue a research question/topic in AI safety, what would it be?
2. What area of AI safety do you find most interesting? What area of AI safety do you find most promising?
