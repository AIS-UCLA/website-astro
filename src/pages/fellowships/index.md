# Intro to AI Safety Fellowship

The best way to get involved with AI Safety at UCLA is to first participate in
one of our introductory fellowships. In these quarter-long fellowshups you will 
learn about AI safety, ethics, and alignment, in addition to gaining technical
expertise in your preferred area of machine learning. The curricula for each of
these areas are available below:

- [Reinforcement Learning](/fellowships/rl): Create an agent that learns to play connect four.
- [Transformers](/fellowships/transformers): Understand language models and build GPT-2 from the ground up.
- [Diffusion](/fellowships/diffusion): Build your own text-to-image generation model like Stable Diffusion.
- [Computer Vision](/fellowships/cv): Design models to analyze images for object recognition and classification, recommended for those with little-to-no machine learning experience.
