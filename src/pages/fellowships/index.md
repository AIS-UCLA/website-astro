# Intro Fellowships

The Intro to AI Safety Fellowship is a 6-8 week, quarter-long course which
explores the impact of increasingly powerful AI systems on society, explains
the problems which the AI safety field is currently working on, and goes over
active areas of research.

The program consists of a series of video and reading lessons which are
accompanied by weekly, collective meetings that expand on the topics covered
in the lessons. You can expect to learn from many prevailing sources in the
field which will help you develop a solid research agenda that you may work
towards in the following quarters.

In the 6-week technical fellowships, participants will complete about 3 hours 
of core content outside of hour-long weekly meetings, split between conceptual 
readings and technical content. In the 8-week governance fellowship, there is 
no mandatory time commitment outside of the two-hour weekly meetings, each of
which will be equally split between readings and discussion. We encourage 
participants to do some or all of the optional readings before each meeting
to dive deeper on topics that interest them!
