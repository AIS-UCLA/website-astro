# Intro to AI Safety Fellowship

## About

The Intro to AI Safety Fellowship is a 6 week, quarter-long course which
explores the impact of increasingly powerful AI systems on society, explains
the problems which the AI safety field is currently working on, and goes over
active areas of research.

The program consists of a series of video and reading lessons which are
accompanied by weekly, collective meetings that expand on the topics covered
in the lessons. You can expect to learn from many prevailing sources in the
field which will help you develop a solid research agenda that you may work
towards in the following quarters.
