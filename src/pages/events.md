# Past Events

## Define, Design, and Align

Define, Design, and Align was an intensive intercollegiate alignment workshop
that took place in January 2023 in Los Angeles. Participants collaborated to
solve open problems in alignment and develop actionable research agendas.

We wrote an in depth forum post about the event [here](//forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SkkAo8W4rg5kGrkTc/we-ran-an-alignment-workshop).

## AI Timelines Workshop

UCLA EA ran an AI timelines retreat for community members interested in
pursuing AI safety as a career. Attendees sought to form inside views on the
future of AI based on an object-level analysis of current AI capabilities.

This event took place in May of 2022.
