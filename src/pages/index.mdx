## What we do

We think that the best way to make progress on the problem of AI safety is
getting more people to focus their careers on AI safety research, in fields
like mechanistic interpretability, adversarial robustness, or AI governance.

We exist to help people interested in this problem skill up in machine
learning, by working on projects that they can both learn from and add to
their portfolios.

We've worked on a variety of projects in the past. [Here are some of our favorites!](/projects)
