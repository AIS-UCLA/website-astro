## What we do

We think that the best way to make progress on the problem of AI safety is
getting more people to focus their careers on AI safety research, in fields
like mechanistic interpretability, adversarial robustness, or AI governance.

Our two main structured opportunities are fellowships and upskilling tracks. All our
curriculum is available online. Click [here](/fellowships) for fellowships,
and click [here](/upskilling-tracks) for the upskilling tracks.

If you'd like see some projects we've worked on in the past, click [here](/projects).

## Resources

As one of the forefront AI clubs at UCLA, we adminisitrate the largest GPU server of any
UCLA club. Members get access to train models on our GPUs (NVIDIA 3090s). Check below to
see a live feed of our GPU utilization (updates every 10 minutes).
