## What we do

We think that the best way to make progress on the problem of AI safety is
getting more people to focus their careers on AI safety research, in fields
like mechanistic interpretability, adversarial robustness, or AI governance.

Our two main structured opportunities are fellowships and upskilling tracks. All our
curriculum is available online. Click [here](/fellowships) for fellowships,
and click [here](/upskilling-tracks) for the upskilling tracks.

If you'd like see some projects we've worked on in the past, click [here](/projects).

Also check out our blog [here](//blog.aisafetyatucla.org/).
