#  Upskilling Post-Fellowship Tracks

AI Safety Upskilling Tracks are intensive 6-8 week, post-fellowship programs designed to help you develop practical, hands-on skills in cutting-edge AI technologies.
These tracks focus on building technical expertise in specialized areas that are crucial for AI safety research, providing you with the concrete tools and implementation experience needed to contribute to the field.

In the 8-week CUDA Track, participants will master parallel computing with CUDA by engaging in technical readings and completing fun implementation assignments outside of hour-long weekly meetings.
