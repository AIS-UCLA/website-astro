# Research Projects

Each quarter, some of our board members lead AI safety research projects with a small team of members (i.e., those who have completed a fellowship). As compared to our upskilling tracks, the research projects are designed to break new ground in the field of AI safety and thus often require more initiative on the part of members. Check out each of the tabs to see the research projects we're running this quarter!
